### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get all books that have never been borrowed

```sql
SELECT 
    b.name AS "Book Name",
    b.author AS "Author"
FROM Book b
LEFT JOIN Issuance i ON b.id = i.book_id
WHERE i.book_id IS NULL;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ List all outstanding books at any given point in time
```sql
SELECT 
    m.name AS "Member Name",
    b.name AS "Book Name",
    i.issued_date AS "Issued Date",
    i.return_date AS "Target Return Date",
    b.author AS "Author"
FROM Issuance i
JOIN Member m ON i.member_id = m.id
JOIN Book b ON i.book_id = b.id
WHERE i.return_date IS NULL OR i.return_date > CURRENT_DATE;
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract the top 10 most borrowed books

```sql
SELECT 
    b.name AS "Book Name",
    COUNT(i.book_id) AS "Times Borrowed",
    COUNT(DISTINCT i.member_id) AS "Unique Borrowers"
FROM Issuance i
JOIN Book b ON i.book_id = b.id
GROUP BY b.id
ORDER BY COUNT(i.book_id) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
